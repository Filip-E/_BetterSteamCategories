# _BetterSteamCategories
website to improve the Steam category system

HOW TO USE:
  1.install node js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
  2. run app.js using node
  3. open home.html
 
Note: Currently the categories are saved as a variable on the server (app.js). 
So the categories you make exist as long as the server is online.
